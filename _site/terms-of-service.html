                        <p>Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and not to use the server as an applicationserver. Using the server to generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of activity that isnot allowed. Scripts should not attempt to manipulate the timeouts on servers. These are set at the presentvalues to ensure the reliability of the server. Sites that reset these do so because they are resourceintensive, and adversely affect server performance and are therefore not allowed. Scripts that are designed toprovide proxy services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.</p>
                        <p>The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page. Scripts that send a single email based upon userentered information, or update a database are acceptable. Scripts that send bulk email or perform processorintensive database processes are not allowed. All outgoing mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to orfrom a AeonFree-hosted domain.</p>
